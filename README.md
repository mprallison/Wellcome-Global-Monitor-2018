# Wellcome-Global-Monitor-2018

In June 2019, Wellcome published Global Monitor 2018.

It surveyed 150000 people from across the world, including demographic data and answers to questions on attitides towards science,medicine and health, with a focus on trust and confidence.  Most articles I saw mentioned beliefs about vaccines. It emerges that East Africa and Southern Asia have the highest confidence in the safety in vaccines, whereas Ukraine and Japan are among the lowest. 
Europe is altogether lower than you might expect and hope. 

My aim is to use the broader survey answers and auxiliary data to flesh out these first headlines. 
The idea being that by better understanding the profile of groups' beliefs, better tactics could be developed to intervene where beliefs lead to worse health outcomes.
Of course this is a big idea.

Understanding how one's beliefs lead to actions is never easy to diagnose, as would be isolating and changing those beliefs considered to be causally efficacious.

Further, there is a question as to whether targeted advocacy is our best strategy of improving health outcomes. 
Perhaps improving availability, making things mandatory or paying people to get vaccines would yield better results?

I don't know anything about psychology/social psychology, but imagine these diciplines would inform prospective answers. 
This is just a first look at some avenues which could be pursued in light of Global Monitor 2018 data.
